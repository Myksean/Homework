            <p><a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">League of Legends</a> is the world's most popular MOBA(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) where a group of players control champions and battle it out for fame and fortune with the end goal being to destroy the enemy nexus!</p>
            <p>In 2009, Nicolo Laurent and David "Phreak" Turley released the game following in the wake of DOTA 2 and quickly rising in popularity. They followed up with swift updates and tutorial videos for players to easily jump into it. In the span of a few months, they had thousands of players enjoying their game. Fast forward to now, it is populated with millions upon millions of players, all competing to be the best in the world. </p>

                <p>LoL is not a difficult game to play but it can be a nightmare to master. There are many mechanics to keep track of at any given moment. Players(including myself) spend years refining all of these skills all for enjoyment or for an edge on the competition:</p>
